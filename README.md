# mcdonalds_menu_dash_app
This is a dash app from a public dataset that I am  still working on.

To run the app you will need the folder named "pages" with the three files inside and after creating that you can run the code "dash_app_multipages".

When you open the app you might see the message "Not Found. The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.", when that happends just refresh the page and the app will work.

In the page "analytics" you will first see the items in the indian mc donalds menu with the biggest and smallest amount of sugar and protein. Below that there are two graphs, one containing the amount of sugar on each item of the menu and the other containing the amount of protein. Lastly, you will find a dropdown with the items that will saw in the begining of the page.

In the page "archive" you will find a button to upload files, you can upload cvs and xls files and see them entirely afterwards.
